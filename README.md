Hello you! This is my FullStack Project 02!!
Wich I Learned to use Dadabase using PostgreSQL and no more "data.json" as was in my FullStack Project 01 haha

The Project doesn't has so much changes, I used SQL language to get all Data shown and made a filter feature
 (Using WHERE ILIKE  and GROUP BY to make a paginate layout), 

And seriously, JavaScript + SQL can just do so many beatifull things in a so easy way that I just loved to learn,
I remember a few repositories ago where I just made a confusing code to filter a table, and now, using SQL, I could see
the beauty of tecnology by how easyly things can be done.


Well that's it, I hope you found interesting and Thank you for your time!!
